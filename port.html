  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
  <p>Hi! I am Katrina Anne but you can call me kath. i am currently attending STI Orca and taking Bachelor of Science Informatio Technology.</p>
  <p>I started out playing piano and guitar, and I also sing, I love dancing too. I feel a passion for music and how it can encourage my emotions. I've been an athlete before in my high school as a gymnastic and pepsquad and also a top 5 student in the class.
  I joined beauty pageant and modeling when I was 16 years old.</p>
  <p>My Family and True Friends are also very important to me. My family and friends have always been there for me, especially though the journey that I'm going through. I wouldn't be the person that who I am today without them.</p>
